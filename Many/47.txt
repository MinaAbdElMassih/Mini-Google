I hoped there would be no answer to this question. I was wrong.
‘Follow me along the western coast of Iceland. Do you see Reykjavik, the capital? Yes. Good. Work your way up along the countless fjords of these shorelines eaten by the sea, and stop a little before the line of 65 ° N. What do you see?’
‘A peninsula rather like a bare bone, with an enormous kneecap at the end.’
‘Not an inappropriate comparison, my dear boy. Now, do you see any- thing on the kneecap?’
‘Yes, a mountain that looks as if it’s sprouted in the middle of the sea.’
‘Good. That’s Snaefells.’
‘Snaefells?’
‘The one and only. A five-thousand-foot-high mountain, one of the most remarkable on the island—and definitely the most famous in the
whole world, if its crater leads to the centre of the globe.’
‘But it’s quite impossible!’ I said, shrugging my shoulders in protest at such a conjecture.
‘Impossible?’ said Professor Lidenbrock severely. ‘And why should that be?’
‘Because this crater is obviously blocked up with lava and scorching
rocks, and so. . . ’
‘And supposing it is an extinct crater?’
‘Extinct?’
‘Yes. There are now only about three hundred volcanoes in activity on the surface of the Earth—but the number of extinct ones is much greater.
Snaefells falls into this latter category, and in historical times has only
had a single eruption, the 1219 one. Since then its rumblings have gradu- ally died down, and it is no longer considered an active volcano.’
I had no reply at all for these categorical statements, so fell back on the other mysteries hidden in the document.
‘But what does the word “Scartaris” mean, and what have the calends of July got to do with anything?’
