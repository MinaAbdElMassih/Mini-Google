‘No!’ I cried indignantly. ‘No! I’m not going to tell my uncle. It would
be terrible if he got to know about such a journey. He’d just want to have a go himself. Nothing would stop a geologist of such determination. He would leave anyway, against all obstacles, whatever the cost. And he’d take me with him, and we wouldn’t come back. Never. Not nohow!’

Sure enough, he sat down in his armchair and, pen in hand, began to write out formulae that looked like algebraic calculations.
I watched his frantic hand: not a single movement was lost on me.
Was some surprising new result suddenly going to spring forth? I was afraid it would, irrationally, since the correct combination, the only one, had already been discovered —and so any other line of exploration was doomed to failure.
