‘Arne Saknussemm!’18  he cried in a triumphant voice. ‘But that is a name to conjure with, and an Icelandic one at that: the name of a scholar of the sixteenth century, a celebrated alchemist.’
I looked at my uncle with a certain admiration.
‘Those alchemists, Avicenna, Bacon, Lull, Paracelsus,19 were the veri- table, nay the only, scholars of their time. They made discoveries at
which we can reasonably be astonished. Why might this Saknussemm not
have hidden some surprising invention in the incomprehensible crypto- gram? That must be the case—that is the case.’

It was there that I expected to find a scholar, but discovered instead a deep analyst.
‘This Saknussemm’, he said, ‘was an educated man. Now, when he was not writing in his mother tongue, he must naturally have chosen the
