THE WORLD’S CLASSICS
JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH

JULES VERNE was born in Nantes in 1828, the eldest of five children in a prosperous family of French, Breton, and Scottish ancestry. His early years were happy, apart from an unfulfilled passion for his cousin Caro- line. Literature always attracted him and while taking a law degree in Par- is he wrote a number of plays. His first book, about a journey to Scotland, was not published during his lifetime. However, in 1862, Five Weeks in a Balloon was accepted by the publisher Hetzel, becoming an immediate success. It was followed by Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas, Around the World in Eighty Days, and sixty other novels, covering the whole world (and below and beyond). Verne himself travelled over three continents, before suddenly selling his yacht in 1886. Eight of the books appeared after his death in 1905— although they were in fact written partly by his son Michel.

WILLIAM BUTCHER was formerly Head of the Language Centre at the Hong Kong Technical College. He has studied at Warwick, Lancaster, London, and the École Normale Supérieure, and has taught languages and pure mathematics in Malaysia, France, and Britain. As well as numerous arti- cles on French literature and natural language processing, he has pub- lished Mississippi Madness (1990), Verne’s Journey to the Centre of the Self (1990), and critical editions of Verne’s Humbug (1991), Backwards to Britain (1992), and Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1992) and Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas (1998) for Oxford World’s Classics.
