opposition, that I wasn’t specially interested in knowing.
‘Runes’, he said, ‘were handwritten characters formerly used in Ice- land and, according to the tradition, were invented by Odin himself. But

This was the appearance of a filthy parchment, which slid out of the book and fell to earth.
My uncle rushed to pick up this knick-knack with an eagerness easy to

mumbo-jumbo-style characters written on it.
The following is the exact facsimile. It is important that these bizarre forms be known, because they were to lead Professor Lidenbrock and his nephew to undertake the strangest expedition the nineteenth century has ever known:

hands, which had begun to shake terribly.
