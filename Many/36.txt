‘Good,’ said the professor without reading it. ‘Now write these words in a horizontal line.’
I did so and obtained the following sentence: Iyylu loleb ouiGe v,trn emtä.
‘Perfect,’ said my uncle, tearing the paper out of my hands. ‘This is beginning to look like the old document: the vowels and the consonants
are both grouped together in the same confusion. There are even capitals in the middle of the words, and commas as well, just as in Saknussemm’s
parchment.’
I couldn’t help thinking that these remarks were highly ingenious.
‘Now,’ said my uncle again, addressing me directly, ‘in order to read the sentence that you have just written and which I do not know, all I
have to do is take the first letter of each successive word, then the sec-
ond letter, then the third, and so on.’
And my uncle, to his great amazement and even more to mine, read out:
I love you, my little Gräuben.
‘H’m,’ said the professor. Yes, without being aware of it, awkwardly in love, I had written out this compromising sentence.
‘Oh, so you’re in love with Gräuben, are you?’ said my uncle in an au- thentic guardian’s tone.
‘Yes. . . No. . . ’ I spluttered.
‘So you do love Gräuben,’ he said mechanically. ‘Well, let’s apply my procedure to the document in question.’
My uncle had returned to his engrossing ideas and had already forgot- ten my risky words: I say ‘risky’ because the scholar’s mind could never understand the matters of the heart. But fortunately, the vital question of the document took precedence.
Just before performing his critical experiment, Professor Lidenbrock’s eyes were throwing sparks out through his glasses. His hands trembled as
he picked the old parchment up again. He was profoundly excited. Finally
he coughed loudly, and in a solemn voice, calling out successively the first letter of each word, then the second, he dictated the following series to me:
