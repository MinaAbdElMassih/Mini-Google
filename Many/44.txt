‘Look,’ I said, giving him the paper with my writing on. ‘Read.’
‘But it doesn’t make sense!’ he replied, screwing it up.
‘No sense, when you begin at the beginning, but. . . ’
I hadn’t finished before the professor produced a shout, more than a shout, an actual roar! A revelation had just occurred in his brain. His face
was transmogrified.
‘Oh, clever old Saknussemm!’ he bellowed. ‘So you wrote your mes- sage backwards?’
And throwing himself on the sheet of paper, his eyes un-focused, his voice trembling, he spelled the whole document out, working his way from the last letter back to the first.27


27 from. . . first: Verne probably derived this method of constructing a cryp- togram from Poe’s ‘The Gold Bug’, which he quotes extensively in his ‘Edgar Poe et ses Éuvres’ (1864).
This was what he read:
In Snefells Yoculis craterem kem delibat umbra Scartaris Julii intra calendas descende, audas viator, et terrestre centrum attinges. Kod feci. Arne Saknussemm.
Which, when translated from the dog-Latin, reads as follows:
Go down into the crater of Snaefells Yocul which the shadow of Scar- taris caresses before the calends28 of July, O audacious traveller, and you will reach the centre of the Earth. I did it. Arne Saknussemm.
As he read, my uncle jumped as if drawing current from a Leyden jar.29  His courage, his joy, his certainty, knew no bounds. He walked up and down; he held his head in both hands; he moved the chairs around; he piled the books up; unbelievably, he juggled with his precious geodes; he threw a punch here, a blow there. At last his nerves calmed down and, like a man exhausted after discharging too much fluid, he flopped back in his armchair.
‘So what time is it?’ he asked after a few moments’ silence.
‘Three o’clock.’
‘H’m, dinner has gone down quickly. I’m dying of hunger. To table. And then after that. . . ’
‘After?’
‘You can pack my trunk.’
