1905         17 March: falls ill from diabetes.
24 March: dies. The French government is not represented at the funeral.
1905–14    On Verne’s death, L’Invasion de la mer (Invasion of the Sea)
and Le Phare du bout du monde (Lighthouse at the End of the World) are in the course of publication. Michel takes responsi- bility for the manuscripts, publishing Le Volcan d’or (The Golden Volcano—1906), L’Agence Thompson and C° (The Thompson Travel Agency—1907), La Chasse au météore (The Hunt for the Meteor—1908), Le Pilote du Danube (The Danube Pilot—1908), Les Naufragés du ‘Jonathan’ (The Survivors of
the Jonathan—1909), Le Secret de Wilhelm Storitz (The Se- cret of Wilhelm Storitz—1910), Hier et Demain (Yesterday and
Tomorrow—short stories, including ‘Le Humbug’ (Humbug)
and ‘L’Éternel Adam’ (‘Édom’)—1910), and L’Étonnante aven- ture de la mission Barsac (The Barsac Mission—1914). Be- tween 1985 and 1993 the original (i.e. Jules’s) versions are published, under the same titles except for En Magellanie (In the Magallanes), ‘Voyage d’études’ (‘Study Visit’), and Le Beau Danube jaune (‘The Beautiful Yellow Danube’).
1978         For the 150th anniversary of his birth, the novelist undergoes
a major re-evaluation in France, with hundreds of editions and thousands of articles, PhDs, and books about them. On a cu- mulative basis, Verne is the most translated writer of all time.
1989–94    Backwards to Britain, ‘Uncle Robinson’, ‘A Priest in 1839’, ‘
‘‘San Carlos’’ and other Stories’, and Paris in the Twentieth
Century, which sets a US record for a French book.
