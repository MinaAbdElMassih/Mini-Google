JULES VERNE 
JOURNEY TO THE 
CENTRE OF THE EARTH 
Translated with an Introduction and Notes by William Butcher
‘to sum up all the. . . knowledge amassed by science, and to re- write the history of the universe.’
Thus Hetzel, Verne’s publisher, ambitiously announced the aims of the se- ries the Extraordinary Journeys in the Known and Unknown Worlds, with which Verne launched his literary career. After Journey to the Centre of
the Earth (1864) came such other masterpieces as The Adventures of
Captain Hatteras, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea, and Around the World in Eighty Days.
Journey to the Centre of the Earth has been consistently praised for its style and vision of the world. It explores the prehistory of the globe, but can also be read as a psychological quest, for the journey itself is as im- portant as arrival or discovery. Professor Lidenbrock and Axel travel across Iceland, and then down through an extinct crater towards a sun-
less sea where they enter a living past and are confronted with the origins of man. A classic of nineteenth-century literature, the novel’s distinctive
combination of realism and Romanticism has marked figures as diverse as
Sartre and Tournier, Mark Twain and Conan Doyle.
